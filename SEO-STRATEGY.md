**Status:** Implementation Required

## THE REALITY

**Business Model:**
- Sugar baby/daddy arrangements (long-term relationships)
- Short-term private companionship meets
- International travel companions
- **NOT:** Staffing company, modeling agency

**Client Search Behavior:**
- "escort cape town"
- "companion services cape town"
- "private arrangements"
- "sugar baby cape town"
- "luxury companions"

**Current Problem:** Site is too "clean" - won't rank for actual client searches

---

## THE STRATEGY

### Balance Two Goals:

1. **Sophisticated Brand Voice** (Customer-Facing)
   - Visible copy remains elegant and refined
   - No crude or transactional language
   - Luxury positioning maintained

2. **Strong SEO Presence** (Hidden Elements)
   - Keywords in meta tags, alt text, page titles
   - Rank for actual searches clients use
   - Google Images traffic optimization

## SERVICE CLARITY UPDATES NEEDED

### 1. Homepage Service Card #1
**Current:** "Premium Entertainment & Exclusive Events"  
**Problem:** Too vague

### 2. Services Page
**Add explicit service categories:**
- **Sugar Dating Arrangements** - Long-term exclusive relationships
- **Private Companionship** - Intimate hourly/overnight experiences
- **Travel Companions** - International and domestic travel
- **VIP Event Companionship** - Public event appearances

### 3. Pricing Page
**Clarify what packages mean:**
- Hourly rates = short private meets
- Overnight/weekend = extended companionship
- Monthly arrangements = sugar baby relationships
- Travel packages = companion experiences

## FILES TO UPDATE

1. **app/layout.tsx** - Add comprehensive meta tags
2. **app/page.tsx** - Restore keywords in alt text, update Service Card #1

4. **app/pricing/page.tsx** - Restore keywords, clarify rate meanings

### Priority 2 - Content Clarity:
